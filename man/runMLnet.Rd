\arguments{
\item{ExprMat}{Matrix, The expression matrix with rows as genes (gene symbols) and columns as cells.}

\item{AnnoMat}{Matrix, The annotation matrix for cell type annotation. The first column is barcode and the second is cell type.}

\item{LigClus}{Vector, cell types that sending signals.}

\item{RecClus}{Vector, cell types that receiving signals.}

\item{Normalize}{Logical, Whether to do normalization.}

\item{NormMethod}{Character, Denotes which normalization method to use. Available options are: LogNormalze, SCTransform. See Seurat package for more details.}

\item{OutputDir}{Character, The output directory of running jobs for now. Generate a working directory to save the final result.}

\item{Databases}{List, The prior database used by running jobs for now. Databases includes Ligand-Receptor interactions (LigRec.DB), Receptor-TF interactions (RecTF.DB) and TF-Target interactions (TFTG.DB).}

\item{logfc.ct}{Numercial, Screening threshold for FindMarkers in Seurat. The default setting is 0.1.}

\item{pct.ct}{Numercial, Screening threshold for FindMarkers in Seurat. The default setting is 0.05.}

\item{pval.ct}{Numercial, Screening threshold for FindMarkers in Seurat. The default setting is 0.05.}

\item{expr.ct}{Numercial, Screening threshold for high expressed gene in groups of cells. Default is 0.05.}

\item{TGList}{List, The target genes of interest in groups of cells (RecClus).}

\item{LigList}{List, The potential ligands in groups of cells (LigClus).}

\item{RecList}{List, The potential receptors in groups of cells (RecClus).}
